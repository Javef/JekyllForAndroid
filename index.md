Jekyll for Android is a very simple client to post on a Jekyll blog from your phone.

It commits a `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` file to the `_posts/` directory of your Jekyll's blog.

The application uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/) and supports [GitHub 2fa](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication).


## Features:

- One time GitHub Login
- Create posts
- Markdown Preview
- Custom YAML front matter
- Jekyll drafts (`_drafts`)
- If not published the post stays as a draft
- View old posts
- Edit/Delete posts
