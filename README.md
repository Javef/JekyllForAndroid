Jekyll for Android
=========================

A very simple client to post on a Jekyll blog from your phone.

It commits a `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` file to the `_posts/` directory of your Jekyll's blog.

The application uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/).

To view the posts we turn to JSON.

To get it to work we just **push** [this](https://raw.github.com/tsagi/tsagi.github.com/master/json/index.html) file in our `username.github.com/json/` directory and we get a list of your posts in the app.

The app asks you to do it for you automatically but you can do it manually yourself!

You can get the latest version to directly install it on your smartphone from the link at the end of the README.
