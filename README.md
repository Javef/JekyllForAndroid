Jekyll for Android
=========================

A very simple client to post on a Jekyll blog from your phone.

It commits a `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` file to the `_posts/` directory of your Jekyll's blog.

The application uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/).

##Features:

- One time GitHub Login
- Create a post
	- Title
	- Category
	- Tags
	- Content (of course)
- If not published the post stays as a draft
- Create a decent icon


##To be done:

- Markdown Preview (using [bypass](https://github.com/tsagi/bypass))
- View posts
- Delete posts

==========

##To compile

Download [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) and Import the Project.

==========

The client is in __Alpha__ stage.

Please fork it, test it and come back with issues :)
