A very simple client to post on a Jekyll blog from your phone.

It commits a `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` file to the `_posts/` directory of your Jekyll's blog.

The application uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/).

You can get the latest version to directly install it on your smartphone from the link at the end of the README.

##Features:

- One time GitHub Login
- Create a post
	- Title
	- Category
	- Tags
	- Content (of course)
- Markdown Preview
- If not published the post stays as a draft
- View posts
- Edit/Delete posts

#To compile

Download [ADT Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and Import the Project.
